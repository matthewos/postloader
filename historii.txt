Priiloader method is still the suggested one

* postLoader doesn't use WII_LaunchTitle to execute channels on real and neek2o. CGT codes should works again in both enviroments.
* New channel launch method, you can choose between "Normal boot method", "Load apploader", "neek2o". For neek2o, read VERY important notice in note

NOTE: How to setup a neek2o nand for real channel launch method
* Use modmii to create a fresh nand. Install only priiloader (required) and if you wish postloader channel. Do not add anything more if you want a fast to boot nand
* name this nand pln2o and put in usb://Nand/pln2o
* Start that nand, configure it (also the network). Install the new neekbooter (required) in priiloader and make priiloader autoboot it (you can use postloader to do that [home]->System options->Install neekbooter.dol in priiloader, when you running in neek2o/pln2o nand)
* postLoader will automatically copy (only one time) your vc/wiiware to pln2o nand and execute it.

* THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL, make a backup of your nands before try it.
