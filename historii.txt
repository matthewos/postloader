postLoader 4.4.8

* gameBrowser: Automatic DM(L)/QuadForce wad installation (please, read notes carefully !!!). Thx to waninkoko WadManager 1.7 source codes.
* gameBrowser: Fixed a bug on reading/writing configuration information
* Increased mp3 buffer size (less disc i/o)
* little fixes

========================================
DM(L),QUADFORCE automatic mode:
========================================

When this option is enabled (press [home] while in gamecube mode, then "GameCube mode"), postLoader will choose and install the correct wad file to execute the selected gc/qf game.
To use this feature, you must create a wads folder in your <dev>/ploader folder, for example usb://ploader/wads if your postloader data folder is in the usb device.
Then rename the dm(l)/qadforce wads as follow

DIOSMIOS_2.10.wad -> dm.wad
DIOSMIOSLite_2.10.wad -> dml.wad
quadforce_4.1.wad -> qfusb.wad
quadforce_4.0.wad -> qfsd.wad

so you will end with the following files

<dev>://ploader/wads/dm.wad
<dev>://ploader/wads/dml.wad
<dev>://ploader/wads/qfusb.wad
<dev>://ploader/wads/qfsd.wad

Use only tested wads, from well known source. Installing these wads should be a safe operation, anyway it is a your choice. No warranty provided, no responsibility on me if you brick anything!

postLoader 4.4.7

* emuBrowser: added cache system. To rebuild, [home]->rebuild cache (it is required also if plugin.conf change)

This make everything fully compatible with standard layout of HBC. Five category are assigned by default: Games/Utility/Emulators/Backup loaders/Hacking tools, and them can be changed in runtime
(A)->View options...->Rename categories
(B)->Change category
(2)->Filter menu, with also sd/usb selection
(home)->refresh cache

postLoader 4.1.9

* Fixed booting wii games from real mode to neek2o.

NOTE: neek2obooter.app
----------------------
As neek2o r96 do not support priiloader, you have to install neek2obooter.app to start games from real mode to neek2o. neek2obooter.app is available from full installation package 4.1.9.

Installation:
in (usb:/nands/pl_eu)/title/00000001/00000002/content/

1) rename your system menu .app to sysmenu.app 
2) copy neek2obooter.app and rename it as system menu

example for 4.3 eu nand

rename 0000009b.app to sysmenu.app
rename neek2obooter.app to 0000009b.app

!!! DO THIS ONLY IN YOUR R96 (and possibily above) NEEK2O, DO NOT TRY IN REAL NAND !!!

This allow also to go back directly to real mode when you select return to menu in games.
neek2obooter.app can also boot directly to postloader when you run your neek2o nand. Just create /title/00000001/00000002/data/n2oboot.ini (also empy) to enable this feature.

* mp3 player: using again MP3Player_PlayFile (no more limits on mp3 lenght, previous it was 4MB)
* added stub for returning to postloader channel when executing homebrews. Postloader channel v5 must be installed. A full stub will be installed in memory, so it is ready to use in neek (take from priiloader). This mode must be selected in advanced option, and may fail with some apps (they will return to hbc). Priiloader method is still the suggested one
* now dols are checked for _arg signature. If not found no arguments structure is passed to it. This leads to dollz to run now without problems (thx tueidj for the hint). Note that wiiflow can't be used to execute games (but wiiflow-mod should)

* postLoader doesn't use WII_LaunchTitle to execute channels on real and neek2o. CGT codes should works again in both enviroments.
* New channel launch method, you can choose between "Normal boot method", "Load apploader", "neek2o". For neek2o, read VERY important notice in note

NOTE: How to setup a neek2o nand for real channel launch method
* Use modmii to create a fresh nand. Install only priiloader (required) and if you wish postloader channel. Do not add anything more if you want a fast to boot nand
* name this nand pln2o and put in usb://Nand/pln2o
* Start that nand, configure it (also the network). Install the new neekbooter (required) in priiloader and make priiloader autoboot it (you can use postloader to do that [home]->System options->Install neekbooter.dol in priiloader, when you running in neek2o/pln2o nand)
* postLoader will automatically copy (only one time) your vc/wiiware to pln2o nand and execute it.
* This is a great workaround for WFC games and games that doens't work in d2x emulation
* THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL, make a backup of your nands before try it.

postLoader 3.59.5

* Fixed a possibile miss/corruption of wiiload header. (thx JoostinOnline)

* If user pressed (B) in "Select NAND Source" to close the menu, the path to nand become corrupted

* uses the same postloader's themes for menu.

postLoader 3.49.1
 
* Added support for mounting usb://nands/* subfolders. Note that d2x v6 has 64 char filename limit. A standard path for a title .app file is 45 char long.

postLoader 3.48.2
 
* WBFS Rescan function was missing

postLoader 3.48.1

* Added wbfs games scanner function for real nand. FAT and NTFS partiotion are supported (thank FIX94 and his forwarder for its partition mounting functions)
* Corrected some strings
* Some code clean

> priibooter 1.9
* if postloader isn't found and you are not in neek mode, selection screen is force
* now search also sd:/appps/postloader/boot.dol and usb:/appps/postloader/boot.dol
* wiimote buttons can be press to enter in interactive mode also during device initialization
* wait-time reduced

> neekbooter 1.1
* if something goes wrong, an error message appear.
* corrected crash if postloader isn't found
* added sd:/appps/postloader/boot.dol to search path
* added ISFS/appps/postloader/boot.dol to search path (so we can read postloader from usb, compatible with neek2o and uneek)
