PLOADER - HISTORII
====================

postLoader 3.45.1
 
* Added support for usb homebrew access on neek2o (READ NOTES)
* Corrected a crash introduced in 3.44.3 if neek2o nand is in the root
* PARTIAL built in game cache rebuilder (READ NOTES)
* Updated readmii to v1.2
 
NOTES:
 
usb homebrew access
-------------------
postLoader thanks to the "magic code" from obcd can now access directly to usb hdd under neek2o. This is enabled with just 2 line of code. KEEP IN MIND, that even
if postLoader will launch any hb, launched hb will not work correctly if relay on data in usb hdd. Every hb like postloader must be updated to run under neek2o like
postloader do. I hope that a lot of homebrew makers will integrate this modification in their applications.
 
Built in game cache rebuilder
-----------------------------
postLoader can now rebuild diconfig.bin by internal function only (ONLY) for the following kind of file structure
 
/wbfs/<gamedescription>[gameid].wbfs
or
/wbfs/<anycharacter>.wbfs
 
it is really much faster then neek2o. Reboot seems to be required.
